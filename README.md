> Alfred 2 workflows.  Nothing fancy, but save me some time.

### Toggle Caffeine.alfredworkflow
Toggles Caffeine on and off and sends a the status of Caffeine to Notification Center.

#### Usage

* cff -- toggles it whether it is on on off

### Toggle Password on Wake.alfredworkflow

When I'm at home I hate that I have to log into the Air I use for work after it's gone to sleep.  This allows me to quickly change the Security setting "Password on wake".

#### Usage

* pw -- toggles 'Password on wake' on and off
